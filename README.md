# PolygonMapGenerator
A C# implementation of the ideas from http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/

The Voronoi Stuff is cobbled together from various explinations across the internet on how Fortune's Algorithm works.

More unit tests always welcome! The Voronoi stuff I feel it's more important to have since it's less striaght forward than the map generation code.

The City generation is a neat thing I threw in there, though it can really slow things up.
